                        Gratuity is a benefit given by an employer to an employee as a token
                        of appreciation for their service and loyalty. It is typically
                        calculated as a certain percentage of an employee&#39;s salary, based on
                        the number of years they have worked for the company. The gratuity
                        amount is paid to the employee upon the completion of a certain
                        period of service or upon retirement, and is meant to provide
                        financial security for the employee in their later years.
